=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Use the plasma alternate fire before going through the teleporters to prevent opponents from following through after you.
* In the large room with two raised tables, there are several pushers allowing you to jump up to higher ground. One of them leads to a dead-end room...and the rocket.
* Use the grenade's alternate fire, or mines, in the slime bridge room and near teleporters to temporarily prevent opponents from traversing near those areas.
