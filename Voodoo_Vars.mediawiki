Place your secret RE voodoo incantations in good hands that won't tell anyone else.

Undocumented commands listed are not well understood; please document them if you know what they do
=== Edit Commands ===

 /dtoutline 0/1 renders all non-occluded triangles 
 /testpvs <int> tests number of potentially viewable surfaces 
 /wireframe 0/1 renders everything in wireframe, with wires the color of the texture inside the square
 /entediting 0/1 determines if entities get selected, useful to texture underneath/around mapmodels
 /showmat 0/1 shows materials if enabled, allows selection of geometry behind materials if disabled
 /maxmerge 0/1 sets the cube size where the remipper will end its geometry optimization; higher numbers lower the geometry quantity at the expense of poorer occlusion
 /floatspeed <int> sets the editing and spectating fly speed
 /lerpangle
 /lerpsubdiv
 /lerpsubdivsize
 /lerptjoins


=== Gameplay commands ===

 /teamalphaname <string> sets team alpha's name to <string>; default is 'alpha' (of course)
 /teamomeganame <string> sets team omega's name to <string>; default is 'omega'

 /teamalphacolour <hex> sets alpha team colour to 0xRRGGBB
 /teamomegacolour <hex> sets omega team colour to 0xRRGGBB

 /gamespeed <int> determines pace of game; 100 is default

 /ffa <map> starts a ffa-deathmatch on <map>
 /insta <map> | /instagib <map> starts an insta-deathmatch on <map>

=== Misc commands ===

 /gpuskel 0/1 appears to be a gpu compatibility setting; on HD 7570 (Terascale 2) on r600/ mesa 17 leaving it enabled led to 10% better fps than disabling it; YMMV
