CubeScript is the scripting language of the [http://cubeengine.com/ Cube 2 engine]. 

In Red Eclipse, it can be used to

* create your own graphical user interfaces (guis)
* customize and modify any of the [https://github.com/red-eclipse/base/tree/master/config/menus in-game menus]
* design scripted events in your maps using [[Entity_Linking#Scriptable_Events|trigger]] entities
* run any sequence of [[Vars_and_Commands_Tables|commands or variable settings]] you can enter in the [[console]]
* evidently, this includes [[Variables|variable mods]], such as a set of weapons with modified characteristics.


==Running scripts==

Scripts are typically saved as '''cfg''' files in the [[Game_Settings#User_Content|user content directory]]. For example, the script ''myvars.cfg'' can be executed using
   /exec myvars.cfg

Notes:

*If [[Vars_and_Commands_Tables|commands or variables]] are entered via the [[console]], each line usually begins with a slash (/). In script files, there are no such leading slashes.

*Scripts can be executed automatically using [[Game_Settings#autoexec.cfg|autoexec.cfg]].
