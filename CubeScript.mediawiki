CubeScript is the scripting language of the [http://cubeengine.com/ Cube 2 engine]. Such scripts can be entered via the [[console]] or executed via files in the [[Game_Settings#User_Content|user content directory]]. This allows to customize many aspects of the game client without the need to compile any sources.

==Use of CubeScript==

To give a first overview, CubeScript can be used to
* customize any of the in-game [[menus]] or create your own custom [[menus]],
* design scripted events in your maps using [[Entity_Linking#Scriptable_Events|trigger]] entities,
* or run any sequence of [[Vars_and_Commands_Tables|commands or variable settings]] you can enter in the [[console]].

==Executing scripts==

Scripts are typically saved as '''cfg''' files in the [[Game_Settings#User_Content|user content directory]]. For example, the script ''myvars.cfg'' can be executed using
   /exec myvars.cfg

Notes:

*If [[Vars_and_Commands_Tables|commands or variables]] are entered via the [[console]], each line usually begins with a slash (/). In script files, there are no such leading slashes.

*Scripts can be executed automatically using [[Game_Settings#autoexec.cfg|autoexec.cfg]].
