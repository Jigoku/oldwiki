=== Overview ===

While at first glance Castle may appear to be a Sauerbraten map, it is in fact a fairly new map, released with Aurora (1.5). Castle's simple yet well-thought out layout has made it a favorite for FFA and Survivor matches. The map combines an open rifle-dominated top area with corridors below that are conducive to shotgun brawls. A pair of portals connects the bottom and top sections of the map as does two sets of stairs.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* You can throw mines through the portals to catch unsuspecting foes.
* The main rocket spawns on top of the pointed tower.
* In kaboom, there's a little-known rocket ''under'' the walkway just outside the lower portal.
