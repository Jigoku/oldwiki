<font color="#FF0000">**WARNING: Before connecting you should read the [Multiplayer Guidelines](Multiplayer_Guidelines "wikilink"), which governs how you may and may not use the master server or any servers listed on it.**</font>

## Connect to an Online Server

-   You can connect to online servers using the server list

or

-   Open the console (~ / t or enter key) and type

`/connect `*`ipnumber`*

Replacing *ipnumber* with the IP of the server

### Join Password

If the server you are trying to connect to has a join password set, you will need to either

-   Right-click on the server entry in the list and set the password

or

-   Connect using

`/connect `*`ipnumber`*` `*`0`*` `*`password`*

Replacing *password* with the correct password (setting *0* uses the default port number).

## Connect to a LAN Server

-   In order to see LAN server in the server list you need to tick the option "Search Lan"

or

-   Open the console (~ / t or enter key) and connect directly

`/connect 192.168.1.###`

or simply

`/lanconnect`

provided there's only one LAN server
