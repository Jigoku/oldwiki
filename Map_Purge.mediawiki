|description = A crazy map design with a virtual reality theme, combined with wild platforming action and some strong pushers. Can you find your way through this maze without getting derezzed?
==Tips== 
Soon you will find a section that requires some wall running. If you have difficulties reaching the far end, try to tap '''Q''' rather than holding the key.
