=== Review ===

A crowd favourite for bomberball and duel modes, this tried-and-true floater is a part of Red Eclipse history, being the first map ever created for the game. Here, blood-stained nebulae fill the sky and the ground is tinged crimson by the glow of a distant eclipse, giving the latest iteration of the classic map a snazzy thematic twist.

===Notes & Strategies===

* Use plasma balls to clog up the path.
* Use the grenade's alternate fire - or cook and throw them - to force your opponent out of hiding.
* Be sure to use wallrunning and take the side wall paths on the left and right sides of the map.
* Using the sword can make people fight or go into flight.
