The basic scoring system used in Red Eclipse deathmatches is as follows, assuming no changes have been made to the default scoring variables:

==Frags==

The bread and butter of the whole game! Simply land the killing shot on an opponent to get a frag and 3 points.

==Assists==

The last shot may get the spoils, but there's still something in it for those who weakened them up first. Any other opponent who chipped in with a hit on the dead player, over the previous 5 seconds before death, will have their name mentioned in the obituary line for an assist, and receive 1 point. Multiple players can receive assists on the same kill, and in a team game this can result in multiple points from assists for the same team. Also note that it doesn't only count damage-dealing attacks, but some weapons that result in near-misses will still give off shockwaves that push players around, and one of those, no matter how slight, still qualifies you to receive an assist. This leads to the somewhat odd result that players can still earn assists even in Instagib mode.

==Team Kills==
{|
|In team games, you have teammates for a reason. Don't kill them, and that includes not shooting yourself in the foot. Doing so brings a harsh penalty: -6 points. (-8 on headshot) The penalty is slightly mitigated to -3 points if the kill is attributed to a rocket, or to one of the sources of ongoing damage (bleeding, electric shock, or burn) but it's still not a good thing by any means. If you get enough team kills in an online game, the server will kick you, or even ban you from ever joining again, and undo the damage your destructive tendencies have had on the team's score.

Note that there is no such thing as a team assist: if you and a teammate get caught in a close range firefight, and you accidentally shoot them with a bullet or two before the opponent finishes them off, your name will not be listed in the assists, and there's no further penalty except that your opponents did just get a frag, and you may well now find yourself outnumbered in the immediate surroundings.

|}

==Suicides==

If you somehow manage to hit yourself with your own bullets and run out of health that way, the result counts as a team kill and is subject to the above scoring. However, there are other ways to die: in some stages, you can jump off the edge into deep space or a lava pit or whatever fits the stage's scenery, eventually colliding with an instant-death plane. Also, you can press K at any time to immediately commit suicide. This is also not desirable, but the penalty for one of these deaths is comparatively light at only -1 point. Note that opponents who hit you just beforehand will still earn assists when this occurs.

==First Blood==
{|
|This bonus can only be awarded once in a match, providing a 1-point bonus to the first human player who scores a frag. Frags made by [[bot]] players are currently not taken into account for handing out First Blood, because bots (who don't have to load the graphical textures and models for a map) often have a several-second head start on the humans in getting set up.
|[[File:Firstblood.png|x50px|First blood reward text]]
|}

==Head Shot==
{|
|If your killing shot hits the head, you get a 1-point bonus for this. Unique among all bonuses, Head Shot is not listed in the obituary line, only as a visual indicator on the screen of the player who scored it (or a pop-up shown above their head, from the other players' perspectives). You can also get a Head Shot message on a team kill, but in this case the message results in no additional points, positive or negative.
|[[File:Headshot.png|x50px|Headshot reward text]]
|}

==Double Kill==
{|
|After you score a frag, if you get another frag within 5 seconds, it will be listed as a double kill. Although a message is shown to signify this, the double kill is worth no additional points beyond what you already get for the frags.
|[[File:Double.png|x50px|Double kill reward text]]
|}

==Triple Kill==
{|
|On the other hand, if you can get a third frag, still within 5 seconds of the first, you get a triple kill bonus, and this one actually does provide extra points. 3 of them, or 4 in case of a head shot (this is on top of the normal frag score, so you'll actually get a total of 6 or 8 points respectively). Other bonuses besides Head Shot will only be worth their normal points; there's no additional bonus for scoring them in combination with a triple kill.
|[[File:Triple.png|x50px|Triple kill reward text]]
|}

==Multi Kill==
{|
|...And if you get a fourth frag that's still in the 5-second window, you get a multi kill bonus, the single most valuable bonus the game has to offer. It's worth 6 bonus points, or 8 if the kill is also a head shot. Lest the scoring spiral out of control, there are no bonuses for any sequence of quick frags beyond 4.
|[[File:Multi.png|x50px|Mutli kill reward text]]
|}

==Carnage==
{|
|If you manage to get 5 frags in a row, regardless of how long they take, without dying or committing any team kills in between, the fifth one will give a message saying that it was "in total carnage", and you receive 1 bonus point. Carnage can only be scored once per player per match; once you get a 5-streak, you won't get any more bonuses for further 5-streaks on subsequent lives.
|[[File:Carnage.png|x50px|Carnage reward text]]
|}

==Slaughter==
{|
|Slaughter is just like Carnage, but it requires a streak of 10 frags, and still only provides the same 1-point bonus. It doesn't have to be achieved on the same life that you get Carnage; you might have a streak of 7 frags and then die, which will prevent you from scoring Carnage again if you manage to string together another streak of 5 on your next life, but if you can extend the streak all the way to 10, you still get to score the Slaughter bonus. Again, once you do, that's the only Slaughter bonus you'll ever be allowed to earn in the entire match. Other players might still be able to earn one of their own, if they're proficient enough.
|[[File:Slaughter.png|x50px|Slaughter reward text]]
|}

==Massacre==
{|
|Of course, it doesn't stop there. A streak of 15 frags earns the Massacre bonus, which is again 1 point, and is subject to the same once-per-match restriction as the others.
|[[File:Massacre.png|x50px|Massacre reward text]]
|}

==Bloodbath==
{|
|Finally, the most difficult bonus in this category is the Bloodbath, which requires a streak of 20. The bonus, still only 1 point, might seem like a total rip-off compared to the level of mastery needed to score it, but it's better than nothing.
|[[File:Bloodbath.png|x50px|Bloodbath reward text]].
|}

==Spree Breaker==
{|
|If you frag an opponent who has an active Carnage or higher bonus, you will get the Spree Breaker title and 1 extra point. Note that it's possible for the player on a killing spree to get team-killed, commit a team-kill, or commit suicide, in which case their spree will come to an end without allowing anyone to score the Spree Breaker.
|[[File:Breaker.png|x50px|Spree breaker reward text]]
|}

==Dominating==
{|
|If you frag the same opponent 5 times, possibly interspersed with any number of kills on other players, or even with your own deaths (as long as none of them were caused by that opponent), the fifth head-to-head kill in a row will give you a 1-point Dominating bonus. You can have active Dominating streaks on any number of other opponents, getting a point for each one, but there are no further bonuses for any consecutive head-to-head kills beyond 5. Also, if you have a Dominating streak against someone, that player will be able to see which direction you're in on their radar, no matter how far away you are. You will not receive the same luxury against them, so be careful! In addition, the dominated player will see [[File:Dominated.png|16px|'Dominated' icon]] over your head and near your nickname in the stats screen to , while [[File:Dominating.png|20px|'Dominating' icon]] will appear in the same places of the dominated player to you.
|[[File:Dominate.png|x50px|Dominate reward text]]
|}

==Revenge==
{|
|If an opponent has a Dominating streak against you, track them down and frag them once to earn Revenge and a 1-point bonus, which also causes you to lose your constant sight of them on radar. After a streak has been broken with Revenge, it's possible to start up a new streak against the same player and score Dominating again. Or maybe the vengeful player will find their fortunes have turned around and they can start up a Dominating streak of their own. You never know!
|[[File:Revenge.png|x50px|Revenge reward text]]
|}

==Enemies==

If the Onslaught mutator is selected, and if the chosen map provides for it by placing the appropriate spawn points, a neutral army of grunts, drones, and/or turrets will swarm the arena. These forces (collectively and internally known as "enemies") do not have a place on the scoreboard, but if one of them administers a frag, the unfortunate victim loses 3 points from their score. Enemies can also be listed for assists, but these are totally inconsequential; there is no further penalty regardless of how many enemies chip in with assists.

Killing an enemy adds to your frag count, but it isn't announced in the obituary feed, and it only provides 1 point instead of the usual 3. If the kill is a head shot (not applicable against turrets), you can earn a second point from that, but otherwise kills against enemies are not taken into account for any other bonuses such as Double Kill or Carnage.

==Other Game Types==

Even though deathmatch scoring rules the day only in deathmatch mode, other game modes still allow you to see players' individual scores by pressing TAB. Although those scores don't actually affect the standings in most cases, points are awarded based on the above system, as well as a few mode-specific bonuses:

===[[Capture the Flag]]===

* Fragging an opponent who holds your flag: 3 points (on top of the points already awarded for the frag)
* Picking up an opponent's flag: 3 points
* Returning your flag to your base: 5 points. If Quick mode is on, you can score this simply by touching the flag; note that there is no bonus for picking up your own flag.
* Capturing an opponent's flag: 5 points

===Defend the Flag===

* Fragging an opponent who is defending one of their flags: 3 points (on top of the points already awarded for the frag)
* Standing near a flag of your own color: 1 point every 2.5 seconds, the same rate at which it adds to your team score. In non-King games, you can leave a flag and it will continue to provide points for your team as long as it remains your color, but it will no longer give points to your own score until you come back into its buff zone.

===Bomber Ball===

* Fragging an opponent who holds the ball: 3 points (on top of the points already awarded for the frag)
* Picking up the ball: 3 points
* Scoring a goal: 5 points
* Scoring an own goal: -5 points, and -1 point to the team score. Note that simply carrying the ball over your base does not count as an own goal; you have to throw the ball and let it fly or bounce into your goal to earn this dubious achievement. It is impossible to score an own goal if Touchdown is selected.
* '''In Hold mode, deathmatch scores are not used.''' Instead, each player's listed score will simply be their contribution to the team score, if it's a team game. Players score 1 point for each second they hold onto the ball, with a penalty of -10 points for holding onto the ball too long and having the timer run out. No other actions affect the points in Hold mode.

===Duel/Survivor===

If either one of these modes are selected, regardless of game type, players' scores are replaced by a different system that tracks the number of rounds they've scored in, and thus their contribution to the team score if it's a team game. In a survivor deathmatch, the winning team only receives 1 point per round regardless of how many players are still alive, but each surviving player at the end gets a point to their own credit. The one exception is that multi-survivor Capture the Flag offers the unique possibility of earning up to 3 points per round (by capturing all 3 other flags simultaneously).
