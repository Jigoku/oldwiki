=== Review ===

This small, watery map provides a game so fast that it will leave you gasping for air when you hit the time limit. The texturing is finely crafted and the layout balanced; an excellent all-rounder for small groups or duel.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* You may not notice it at first, but most of the lights in bath pulse.
* The rocket spawn is in the lower center of the map; be sure to grab it quick to get some quick kills.
* This is an underrated duel map, the weapons are nicely placed and rounds go quite fast
* Don't try to camp here; bath may look complex at first glance but it is very easy to maneuver around
