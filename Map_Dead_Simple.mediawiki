=== Notes & Strategies ===

* This map is based on MAP07 from ''DOOM II: Hell on Earth''.
* Wallkick to scale the walls onto the roof.
* Watch out when going in the middle near the water and Flamer, you'll be the center of attention.
* There are an awful lot of weapons on a pretty small map here; you'll have a lot of choice.
