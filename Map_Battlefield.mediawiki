<sup>a</sup> ''There are two additional shotgun entities on the map which have the mode restriction "not classic", which cause them never to appear at all.''

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* ''Battlefield'' is a remake of the map ''Warground'' from ''Blood Frontier''.
* In deathmatch and capture the flag, the rocket is on the high catwalk at the very center of the stage. In bomber ball and defend the flag, that rocket disappears, as the flag or ball appears in that spot instead. It's replaced by two others, on the lower level between each team's base and the small pond.
* When making your way up to the catwalk, go to one of the platforms in the corner of a base and run along the walls, so you can be higher up and don't have to climb the ladder as far.
