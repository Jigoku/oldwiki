|description = A mysterious temple with many traps and hidden passages to explore. The difficulty curve is rather steep for an official race map, and an impulse launch is needed to finish a lap.
==Tips==
* The various secret passages will not work as shortcuts, but alternate routes allow you to sneak past your enemies in gauntlet games.
* In onslaught-gauntlet games, gun turrets will pose an additional challenge. 
* In the large room with the golden sphere, there are several options for a wall run.
* For players who have not mastered the impulse launch, the final jump of this map can be rather frustrating.
