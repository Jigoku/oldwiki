==Basic usage==

The texture menu ('''F1''' key) allows to preview all currently loaded textures. Clicking the preview will apply it to the currently selected geometry (cube faces). The list of available textures is sorted dynamically: Whenever a texture is used, it is moved to the top of the list. 

Recently used textures can be applied quickly to the current selection by holding the '''Y''' key and using the scroll wheel.

The texture on the currently selected face can be moved to the top of the texture list using the '''J''' key or the command
   /gettex

To replace all occurrences of a texture, select any face with that texture, apply a new texture and then use the command
    /replace
The same can be done only for the currently selected volume using
    /replaceinsel

==Culling and loading textures==

When finalizing the work on a map, it is reasonable to remove all unneeded texture definitions from the configuration. This can be done with the command
    /texturecull
'''Note:''' The default set of textures can be added back to the map's texture list using
    /exec config/map/textures.cfg

==Altering textures==

There are various ''v''-commands to create texture variations, e.g. by altering the scale, tinting or shader properties. Whenever such a command is applied to the selected face, a new texture slot is added to the current texture list ('''F1''' menu/ '''Y''' key). Most of these commands will replace the corresponding parameter(s) of a texture.

'''Note''': If the texture command is preceded by a ''vdelta'' command, the settings are not overridden, but added or merged. For instance, repeatedly using
   vdelta voffset 0.125 0
will gradually shift the texture to the right, while the same command without a ''vdelta'' will keep an offset of ''1/8 0''.

The ''vdelta'' command is also necessary to apply different ''vshader'' settings to a texture, such changing the coloring of glow and specular lighting.

Here is a list of selected ''v''-commands.

<table cellspacing="10" style="width:100%">

picks up the texture from the face currently selected.

<tr><td width="174">
/vscale ''factor''
</td><td width="219">
creates a scaled version of the texture face selected
Min: /vscale .125

/voffset ''dx dy''

/vcolor R G B
</td><td width="219">
creates a virtual texture slot with adjustable color from the texured face currently selected
ex: /vcolor 1.0 0.2 0.2 will create a red version

applies the colour from set N with id V from the builtin palette.

Set "0" - Pulse Colours
0: turn off all palette effects

3: disco pulse colours (bomber-ball)

Set "1" - Team Colours
0/1/2/3: only enforced in teamplay games
