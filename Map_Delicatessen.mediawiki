=== Review ===

LuckyStrike's iconic team deathmatch/CTF map features an aging cityscape beset with a mysterious, tantalizing atmosphere. Seek out your foes on the street level, or rise to the city's tallest stories to snipe at those ensconced within the fog's shroud.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* There are a couple of broken windows on each side; climb the walls up to them in order to reach a sniper spot. The one closest to each flag also contains a supply of grenades.
* The rocket spawns high in the middle of the central building. Either use the pushers to launch up to it from the lower level, or double-jump across the gap if you're coming from the upper level.
