===Notes & Strategies===

* The jumping pad at the back of each base can help you make a quick getaway in ''Capture The Flag''
* The catwalks make good places to snipe
* Jump between levels in Bomber Ball to throw off your opponents.
* The rocket spawns at the very center of the stage, over the gap on the upper level. There is a pusher on the lower level which will quickly launch you up to it.
