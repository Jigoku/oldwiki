== Windows ==

* Download [http://redeclipse.net/download/windows the Windows installer].

If you get a permission denied error during install, right click the installer and [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-do-i-run-an-application-once-with-a-full-administrator-access-token Run as Administrator]. Alternatively, you can change the install location to a user-writable folder (like "[My] Documents") during the install process.

== Linux ==
* Install git, curl and the runtime dependencies of Red Eclipse.
** On a Debian-like system (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint), this can be done with the command:
*** <code>sudo apt-get install git curl libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-2.0-0</code>
** On a Fedora system, this can be done with the command:
*** <code>dnf install curl SDL2 SDL2_mixer SDL2_image</code>
* Download [http://redeclipse.net/download/linux the Linux tarball].
* When it is done, move the resulting TAR.BZ2 file to your home directory (~/ or $HOME = /home/username).
* Extract the contents into your home directory using your favourite archive utility.
** Terminal command: <code>tar -jxvf redeclipse_X.Y.Z_nix.tar.bz2</code>
* Enter the resulting folder (which will be called <code>~/redeclipse-X.Y.Z</code> where X.Y.Z is the version number of the package).
* Run <code>./redeclipse.sh</code>

== OS X ==

* Download [http://redeclipse.net/download/osx the OS X tarball].
* When it is done, click the resulting TAR.BZ2 file in your downloads folder on the dock.
* Archive utility will extract the contents into the same folder and open a Finder window with <code>redeclipse.app</code> highlighted.
* Drag and drop the <code>redeclipse.app</code> package to your favourite location (Desktop, Applications folder, whatever).
* Run <code>redeclipse.app</code>.

If this is the first time running the app, the operating system complains that it can't run an unsigned package, simply right (or cmd) click and select <code>Open</code>. In future you will be able to run the app as normal, this will override the warning for all future attempts. You can also do this [http://osxdaily.com/2015/07/15/add-remove-gatekeeper-app-command-line-mac-os-x/ from the command line].
