=== Overview ===

Enyo is a large, nearly symmetrical, team map with a style somewhat reminiscent of Ghost. Unlike ghost, however, Enyo lacks quick-travel pushers and instead trades them for a relatively complex, but open, layout. Enyo is best suited for team games, such as TDM, CTF, or Bomber-ball. 

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Enyo has ''two'' rockets, one above each base's roof.
* Beware snipers (and the rocket) on the rooftops.
* While the map is symmetrical, the weapon placement is not.
