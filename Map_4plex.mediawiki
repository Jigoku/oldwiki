=== Review ===
Gloriously symmetrical and ridiculously grey, 4plex by Damien is a space map for the ages. Launch toward the chaotic center area using the pushers at each of the lower bases, and grab that rocket to punish those without a flying license.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* This map has an abundance of powerful pushers; use their force wisely, to propel you in the right direction. 
* The rocket spawns in the middle of the map, on the top platform.
