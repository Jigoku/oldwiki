=== Notes & Strategies ===

* ''This map does not have any swords.''
* Double jump off the pushers to clear the wall of lasers.
* The rocket spawns in the middle field. The pushers around it are arranged in an X formation.
* Be careful to avoid all of the glowing red pushers, which will throw you up into the deadly lasers.
