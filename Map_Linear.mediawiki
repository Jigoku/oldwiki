=== Notes & Strategies ===

* To get the rockets above the two bases, you must carefully climb one of the towers in the back corner of the base all the way to the top, then double-jump toward it and grab it.
* To get the rocket in the middle of the map, you must fly off one of the raised central pushers and jump in mid-air, producing a large upward boost because of the pusher's momentum. You'll fly above the rocket, so be careful to grab it on the way back down.
