=== Notes & Strategies ===

* You can climb up the waterfall by just walking against it.
* There are two towers near the center of the stage that you can climb with wall kicks. Each one has a rifle at the top, and an opportune place to use it.
* In between those towers, there is an unfinished building. Either climb up one of its support beams or take the ladder on either end up to its upper level, where a rocket awaits.
