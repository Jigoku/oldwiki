== DESCRIPTION ==

Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of environments.

'''redeclipse''' is a script which executes the '''redeclipse''' binary from the ''/usr/lib/games/redeclipse'' directory.

The recommended way to change the settings of the client are to edit the ''config.cfg'' and ''init.cfg'' files in the home directory.

The redeclipse client starts a local loopback server upon launch which it uses to connect to for singleplayer, hence many of the server options are accepted by the redeclipse binary as well (see '''[/cgi-bin/man/man2html?6 redeclipse-server redeclipse-server]'''(6)). To edit the specific settings related to the loopback server, use the ''localexec.cfg'' and ''localinit.cfg'' files in the home directory.

== CAVEATS ==

Many of these options will, if used, be permanently saved in the init.cfg file.

== OPTIONS ==

=== Filesystem options ===

; '''-h'''''homedir''
: Sets your home directory to ''homedir''. Red Eclipse will look for files in this directory in addition the normal installation directory. All user files will be written to the home directory. Defaults to ''$HOME/.redeclipse/''.
; '''-p'''''packagedir''
: Includes the data files found in ''packagedir''. Can be used for adding additional mods. Packages will be loaded in the order specified. By default redeclipse only includes data files in its working directory ''/usr/share/games/redeclipse/data/'', and in the ''temp'' subdirectory of the home directory.
; '''-o'''''sauerdir''
: Sets the path to your Sauerbraten directory. If Red Eclipse can find your Sauerbraten directory, you can load and play Sauerbraten maps from withing Red Eclipse.
; '''-g'''''logfile''
: Output log to ''logfile''. Path is set relative to ''homedir'' unless a leading ''''/'''' is used

=== Video options ===

; '''-df'''{0|1}
: Turns fullscreen mode on or off. 0 to disable, 1 to enable. Defaults to 1.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-dw'''''width''
: Sets screen width to ''width''. If height not specified, also sets height to 3/4 of width. min is 320.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-dh'''''height''
: Sets screen height to ''height''. If width not specified, also sets width to 4/3 of height. min is 320.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-du'''{0..3}
: Set shader quality. 0 for none, 1 for shaders with fastest quality, max is 3. Defaults to 1 where hardware supports it.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-dv'''{0|1}
: Turns vertical sync on or off. 0 to disable, 1 to enable. Defaults to 0.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-da'''''samples''
: Sets full-scene anti-aliasing (FSAA) to ''samples'' samples.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-dc'''''depth''
: Sets colour depth (bits per pixel) to ''depth''.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-ds'''''bits''
: Sets stencil buffer bits to ''bits''.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-dd'''''depth''
: Sets z-buffer depth to ''depth''.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg

=== General options ===

; '''-x''''''command1''<nowiki>; </nowiki>''command2''<nowiki>; </nowiki>''...'''
: Executes a list of commands once Red Eclipse has started up.
; '''-k'''{0|1}
: Enables or disables kid mode, which reduces blood and death effects somewhat. 1 enables reduced gore, defaults to 0.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''-v'''{0..4}
: Sets verbosity. This affects how much information is printed to the console. 0 is the least verbose, 4 is the most verbose, defaults to 0.
;
: This configuration is stored in init.cfg
; '''--help'''
: Display this manpage

; '''-ss'''''{0..3}''
: Sets the server type of the local server. 0 for local only, 1 for private, 2 for public, 3 for dedicated. Defaults to 1. If set as dedicated (3) redeclipse will act similarly to redeclipse-server and not start the GUI.
; '''-sm'''''servermaster''
: Connects to ''servermaster'' to get the list of available servers, defaults to play.redeclipse.net.
; '''-sa'''''servermasterport''
: Contacts the master server using port ''servermasterport'', defaults to 28800.

== EXAMPLES ==

'''redeclipse -p$HOME/mod/data'''

;

== HISTORY ==

Red Eclipse was forked as a continuation of the game Bloodfrontier, which in turn was based on the Cube2 engine and the Sauerbraten game. Red Eclipse and Sauerbraten are now developed in parallel.
