Two years in the making, Red Eclipse is back for the biggest release yet; v1.5 "Aurora Edition".

[600px](file:Re150.jpg "wikilink")

We've been working hard on all areas of the game, improving weapon balance, refining the user interface, and helping new players learn the game. Included in this release is our new auto-updating mechanism, designed to keep you running the latest improvements and freshest maps.

This release is also our first release as a true community built game. With a recent move to GitHub, the project is now openly developed, allowing everyone to contribute to the game we all love in a format where everyone gets a say (and learns how to contribute at the same time). If you feel like you'd have something to [contribute](How_to_contribute "wikilink"), come see us in action!
