In Windows the User Content directory is at '''Username\My Documents\My Games\Red Eclipse'''. You may need the necessary rights for this folder in windows vista or windows 7. 

This is a separate directory from the Installation directory '''C:\Program Files\RedEclipse\data''' but the game treats both directories as the same allowing you modify game content without replacing the original game assets.



ex: any maps you save in game are stored in '''Username\My Documents\My Games\Red Eclipse\maps'''

all default maps in the installation directory are stored in '''C:\Program Files\RedEclipse\data\maps'''

any maps you have downloaded from a server are located in '''Username\My Documents\My Games\Red Eclipse\temp'''



for '''Windows''' the user content directory is '''Username\My Documents\My Games\Red Eclipse'''

for '''Mac OS''' the user content directory is '''/Users/<name>/Library/Application Support/redeclipse'''

for '''Linux''' the user content directory is '''~/.redeclipse'''
