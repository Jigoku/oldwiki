== Key bindings ==

=== Defaults ===
All default keybinds are read from data/defaults.cfg and uses the general syntax:
 bind "''KEY''" [ ''command'' ]

Multiple keys are assigned to the same command by multiple bind lines with the same "command".

=== Modifying ===
Modifying keybindings can be done in several ways:
* Ingame via Options -> Keys (this saves the settings to config.cfg)
* Ingame via the console (this also saves the settings to config.cfg)
* By editing config.cfg situated in your redeclipse home directory
* By editing data/defaults.cfg.

To edit commands via the ingame console open it with ~ or / (or t) and just prepend the bind command with a "/", in this example we bind the console input to the minus key "-":
 /bind "MINUS" [saycommand /]

To add a permanet keybind to config.cfg, just add additional line of the same format as in data/defaults.cfg:
 bind "MINUS" [saycommand /]

=== Disabling ===
Note that at the moment it is not possible to permanently disable keybindings by editing them via the ingame options.

In order unbind a key you will need to instead bind the key to ''nothing'', using either the console or by directly adding it to config.cfg:
 bind "C" [""]
Alternatively you can remove the original bind from data/defaults.cfg

=== Edit Mode Keys ===
[[Editing Controls|Edit Mode keys]] may be bound seperately from regular Gameplay keys using "editbind" instead of "bind".

The command to bind E to the /gettex command via the ingame console would thus be:
 /editbind "E" [gettex]

=== Spec Mode Keys ===
Spectator Mode keys may be bound separately from regular Gameplay keys using "specbind" instead of "bind".
For example:

 /specbind "E" [echo "This only works while spectating"]


=== Onrelease ===
Key bindings also allow to trigger a second action when the key is released. For example, this can be used to fast-forward playback of a demo recording by holding the F key:
 /specbind "F" [sv_gamespeed 10000; onrelease sv_gamespeed 100]
