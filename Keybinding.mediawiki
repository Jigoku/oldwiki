Key binds allow to execute predefined actions by pressing a key. These could be basic [[Guide#Controls|controls]], some commands or even complex [[cubeScript|scripts]].

==Options and configuration==

Some of the most useful key binds can be edited via the following menu: Main menu, options, keys.

Simply click the field for a given command and press the key you want for this bind.
Any binds you save from the options menu are stored in a configuration file ''config.cfg'' in the [[Game_Settings#User_Content|user content]] directory.

==bind command==

The file ''config.cfg'' will contain bind commands of the following syntax:

    bind ''KEY'' [ ''command'' ]

For example:
    bind KP1 [echo number pad 1 pressed]

'''NOTE:''' A bind command will override any actions previously bound to that key!

A text editor can be used to edit this file, however it should be noted that a configuration file is written automatically when the Red Eclipse client is closed.

The [[console]] can be used to bind keys, too. These binds will also be saved to the file ''config.cfg'' in the [[Game_Settings#User_Content|user content]] directory. Note that to enter commands in the console, a leading forward slash is needed

    /bind ''key'' [ ''command'' ]

In the following sections, the syntax of a configuration file is used, i.e. no leading slash.

=== Disabling ===

To free a key bind, simply assign ''no action'' to that key.
    bind "C" [ ]

=== Edit Mode Keys ===
[[Editing Controls|Edit Mode keys]] may be bound separately from regular keys using "editbind" instead of "bind".

The command to bind E to the /gettex command via the ingame console would thus be:
 /editbind "E" [gettex]

=== Spec Mode Keys ===
Spectator Mode keys may be bound separately from regular Gameplay keys using "specbind" instead of "bind".
For example:

 /specbind "E" [echo "This only works while spectating"]

=== Onrelease ===
Key bindings also allow to trigger a second action when the key is released. For example, this can be used to fast-forward playback of a demo recording by holding the F key:
 /specbind "F" [sv_gamespeed 10000; onrelease sv_gamespeed 100]

===Multiple keys or actions===
Multiple keys can be used for the same command by using multiple bind lines.
In return, multiple actions can be done in a single bind command:
    bind ''key'' [ ''action1'' ; ''action2'' ... ]

==Bind search==

There are also commands to look up which action is bound to a given key

    /echo getbind( KEY )

or to list the keys bound to a certain actions

    /echo (dobindsearch ACTION)

==Defaults==

All default keybinds are read from a configuration file in the install directory, which holds similar commands.

  red-eclipse/config/setup.cfg

'''NOTE:''' Just as with anything else in the install directory: Do not edit this file manually!
