=== Overview ===
A new take on the Q3 map Campgrounds (Q3DM6), RE's Campgrounds features a much more open map as well as styling that both shares retro and futuristic elements. Campgrounds is suitable for FFA, but rifles may be considered a tad overpowered due to the open layout. 

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Beware snipers due to the open layout.
* The rocket is high on the very center of the central atrium.
* Placing mines at the top of the jumpers is very common, so watch out!
* There are only four grenades on this map.
