==Master Server==
Trusted moderators are given access to the [http://github.com/red-eclipse/master master repository] which contains the environment for the master server, this includes the global ban (and other) lists. If you don't want to do a git checkout of the repository, you can edit the files using the GitHub visual editor and commit directly to the repository from there. The server runs the update sequence every ten minutes (X:00, X:10, X:20 .. X:50), at which point the master server will reload the configuration and pass the updated information to all connected servers.
