=== Review ===
This old-timer from Blood Frontier days can still provide loads of action when the sun goes down. The balanced two-base layout is excellent for small TDM matches.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* By aiming at an upward angle and wallkicking, you can hop out of the middle lower bridge area.
* Use the alternate routes on the right sides of the bases to throw off opponents in CTF.
* Double-jump forward off of the center platform on each side of the main chamber to reach the rocket spawn.
