## Using the Console

The Tilde key (~) and the Forward Slash key (/) open the Console. The Console is used to issue [commands](commands "wikilink") not bound to any key. An important function of the console is Auto-complete.

Console commands may also be issued from the chat (t)

With the Console open:

-   Pressing the TAB key will cycle through all of the commands similar to what you have typed into the console.

<!-- -->

-   Pressing the Up Arrow key will cycle through a history of previously executed commands.

<!-- -->

-   Pressing Enter will execute the command.

<!-- -->

-   Using Auto-complete can speed up inserting items and executing commands.
