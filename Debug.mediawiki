To submit a [[Readme#Get_Involved|bug report]] that concerns a crash to the Red Eclipse Team, it is helpful to have a backtrace.

== Windows ==

[http://codeblocks.org You must download and install Code::Blocks for easiest building on Windows.]

=== Setting up Code::Blocks (64 bit) ===
* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm64-gcc-5.1.0-2.exe/download Install TDM-GCC-64]
* You may need to set the compiler to TDM-GCC-64, go to Settings -> Compiler -> Global Compiler Settings -> Toolchain Executables

[[File:Win64dbg06.png|thumb|Example compiler settings for TDM-GCC-64, paths may need changed depending on where you installed it.]]

=== Compiling Red Eclipse ===
* Select the debug build (redeclipse-amd64-dbg)
* Press the Build button.

=== Running Red Eclipse and Retrieving the Backtrace ===
* Press the Debug/Continue button.
* Red Eclipse will now start, attempt to crash it.
* Once crashed, you will see the debugger near the bottom of the screen with a Command input. Write 'bt full' in that command input and press enter.
* This will produce a backtrace, copy and paste this to an accessible place such as a crash report on the Red Eclipse forum or a paste service to be linked on IRC.

== Linux ==
On Linux-based systems, you can use GDB to get a backtrace:

First you must compile with debug symbols:
<source lang="bash">
make -Csrc clean && CXXFLAGS=-ggdb3 make -Csrc install
</source>

Then run with GDB:
<source lang="bash">
gdb src/redeclipse_linux
</source>

Inside GDB, to start Red Eclipse:
<source lang="text">
run
</source>

Once Red Eclipse has crashed, GDB will catch this and present a prompt. At this prompt run:
<source lang="text">
bt full
</source>

This will produce a backtrace, copy and paste this to an accessible place such as a crash report on the Red Eclipse forum or a paste service to be linked on IRC.
