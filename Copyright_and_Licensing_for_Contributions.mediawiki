== Notes ==

# {{fnb|GPL}} The GPL and the CC-BY-SA-3.0 are incompatible licenses, that means that a combined work from data using both licenses (for example a screenshot) might be undistributable, we want to avoid this. If the GPL license has a "Font Exception" clause or similar, this should not be a problem.
# {{fnb|CC-old}} The CC licenses prior to 3.0 are unclear on some key points, and may not be very good licenses because of this, see for example [http://evan.prodromou.name/ccsummary/ccsummary.html this summary] for more information, note that if your work is an Adaptation of a work based on versions prior to 3.0 you can upgrade the license to version 3.0 and it works out ok.
# {{fnb|RE-team}} Copyright assignment to the Red Eclipse team is the case for a lot of the contributions by the regular developers of Red Eclipse, which also are a part of the Red Eclipse Team, so the copyright is shared. The Red Eclipse Team is not a well defined group, other than Quinton "quin" Reeves and Lee "eihrul" Salzman being the Team Lead.
# {{fnb|CC+}} The plus (+) here meaning version 3.0 or later.
# {{fnb|compatible}} For MIT (Expat), Zlib, CC-BY-3.0, and CC-BY-SA-3.0 this is normally fairly straightforward; the resulting license for a combined work will be the rightmost one in that order (i.e. the most restrictive). For anything more advanced, do some reading and/or ask around.
# {{fnb|PD}} Public Domain is not a license, modern use of "Public Domain" is often considered unclear, depending on whom you ask. See  http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Public_domain for more information. [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ CC-0] (or similar all-permissive licenses) is normally the best way to do the conceptual equivalent of "Public Domain".
