=== Overview ===
A gladiator-only map, Singularity features two platforms inexplicably skirting a deadly singularity.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* The grenades are located in the middle of each platform
* The singularity can be exploited for grenade bankshots and gravity assists, but is fatal if you get sucked in.
