== CREATING A LIGHT ==



Creating A Spherical Light Entity: 
Open the Console with the Tilde Key (~) or Forward Slash (/)...

 /newent light 300 180 180 180

...This will create a Light Entity with a ''radius'' of 300 and ''Red Green and Blue Values'' of 180.


Once an entity is created, its parameters can be changed by highlighting the Entity, then;
pressing the Period Key to enter the desired setting through /entset, or...
Holding the corresponding Number Key to the parameter you wish to change while scrolling the Mouse Scroll Wheel.

To Move and Entity, click the face corresponding to the axis you wish to move it on with the Left Mouse Button and Drag.


Once you have created a Light Entity you can create a lightmap texture for your map by using the calclight command

 /calclight 
or press the F3 shortcut key.


If you find that calclight takes too long due to the detail in your map, raise the lightprecision to speed up calculating.

 /lightprecision 256


To hide the lightmap and continue editing your map turn on fullbright mode

 /fullbright 1
or press the shotcut key "B"


To change the base ambient light color for your map (shadow color)use the /ambient command. The default ambient is dark grey

 /ambient 25 25 25

    <td width="219">sets the resolution of the lightmap textures contained withing the .mpz map file .This setting greatly effects the size of the map. It is recommended that you raise this setting to keep the number of lightmap textures under 3.</td>

<tr>
    <td width="174">/lightlod #</td>
    <td width="219">sets the level of detail for the lightmap. A higher number creates sharper shadows.</td>
