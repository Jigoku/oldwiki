=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Stay on the upper ledges to snipe.
* Stay near the flag platform or in the doorway next to it to defend the flag in CTF.
* There is a cave near each of the bases, with a rocket in the deepest recesses of each cave. Use the teleport pads to get back to the entrance quickly.
* In the modes where it exists, the third rocket can be found in the middle of the stone bridge at the very top of the map.
