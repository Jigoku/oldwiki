Bomber Ball is a [[GameModes_and_Mutators|game mode]] in Red Eclipse, in which every team has a base, and there is one ball that spawns on the map. The objective is to get the ball to the enemy base, thus destroying it.

Since this is a team mode, a lot of strategy related to Bomber Ball is similar to that of [[Capture the Flag]] mode.

==Mutators==
===Survivor===
This mutator introduces another level of strategy to the game. Just like in Capture the Flag, a round ends if either a base was destroyed, or all of the teammates are down. So [[Guide#Controls|suicide]] might be a good idea if all the teammates are down, and the team is at a disadvantage.

==Strategy==
===Blitzkrieg===
One teammate always stays near the ball spawn point, and once the ball is spawned, he rushes to the enemy base, while other teammate takes a defensive position near the spawn point again. If executed successfully, scoring becomes as fast as possible. Very similar to the [[Capture the Flag#Blitzkrieg|blitzkrieg]] maneuver observed in Capture the Flag games.
