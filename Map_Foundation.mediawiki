=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Lunge at the pushers to jump higher off of them.
* The rocket is just off the ground in the center of this figure-8 stage.
* If you select Onslaught mode on this map, prepare to have your hands full. There are 24 grunt spawns, as well as 6 turrets, making things far more crowded than usual on a map as small as this.
