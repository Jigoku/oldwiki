=== Review ===

A classic TDM map styled after an abandoned city, Center is a staple of online matches. Be sure to conserve your impulse maneuvering around and on top of the buildings here, as you will run out faster than you think.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* The bland texturing of center deserves some much-needed TLC to keep up with the newer maps' quality.
* Sneak in and fall on the flag from the open vents near the roofs of the bases.
* Snipe near cover, open roofs will leave you vulnerable to other people with Rifles.
* Wallkick repeatedly to scale the sides of the buildings.
* The rocket spawns on top of the biggest building in the middle - choose your target(s) carefully.
* Mine the vents and entrances to the base to defend against attacks.
