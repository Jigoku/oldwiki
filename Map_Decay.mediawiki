=== Overview ===

A large and sometimes confusing map, Decay makes for a fun FFA with lots of players online. 


=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Decay's lone rocket is located above a vertical shaft in the tallest room.
* The fans are insta-kill. Don't fall in!
* Most of the doors will retract.
* The teleporter is one-way, so don't expect a round trip!
