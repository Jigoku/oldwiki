|description = Test chamber is one of the earliest maps of Red Eclipse and a true all-time-favorite. With plenty of checkpoints, this is a great race map not only for beginners. 
==Tips==
* For a traditional testchamber experience, use the endurance mutator.
* Without said mutator, the pace can get very fast, which gives experienced runners an even bigger advantage.
