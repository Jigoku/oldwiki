== Technical questions ==

=== Where do I find screenshots, logs and other user data? ===
The location of user content varies on different operating systems.
==== Windows ====
Check the "My Games" folder in your documents:
 %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\My Games\Red Eclipse
==== Linux ====
See the .redeclipse user data in your home directory:
 ~/.redeclipse
==== Mac/OSX ====
Check the app data in your home directory:
 /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Red Eclipse

=== When I launch the game, there's a terminal. Is that normal? ===
Yes. Red Eclipse will automatically check for updates, and you will see a terminal while the updater script is running.

=== That terminal just closes, and the game does not start. What's wrong? ===
Then there's a problem with the updater, for instance missing permissions to replace or delete files. On windows for example, right-click the game launcher and try to "Run as administrator". If the updater still hangs or fails, try a fresh install, but that really should not be necessary.

=== What does 'devel' mean? ===
This is the development version of the game, which can be [[obtain development version|obtained]] from our Github repository to check out upcoming features and life on the bleeding edge.

=== What does master and stable mean? ===
These are the two branches of our base repository on gituhb, http://github.com/red-eclipse/base/. The stable branch is for the current release version of the game. This also includes important bug fixes that are fetched via automatic updates. The master branch is for the current development version.

=== I found a bug, where can I report it? ===
Technical problems can be discussed on the [http://redeclipse.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=7 forum's help board]. Evident bugs can be reported on the [https://github.com/red-eclipse/base/issues issue list], but please avoid opening duplicate issues.

=== I found a cheater, what can I do? ===
If you think someone cheats or violates the [[Multiplayer Guidelines]] in some other way, you can open a topic on the [http://redeclipse.net/forum forums]. Be sure to attach a [[demo]] record of the game, so the problem can be investigated. Convictable cheaters will be sanctioned accordingly.

== Gameplay questions ==

=== dm, pzap, gg - what did they just say? ===
For frequently used abbreviations and player slang, see [[glossary]].

=== What are those symbols near player names? ===
These are the [[privileges]] or ranks of registered players. You can request your own player account on www.redeclipse.net/apply.

=== Why is there a timer when I get killed? ===
There is a delay before you can respawn. This adds a tactical value to defeating enemy players, as the time-out is an advantage for your team.

=== I hit a guy many times with my shotgun, why didn't he die? ===
It is easy to hit someone with a shotgun, but the weapon is really only effective at close range. Each loadout weapon has its pros and cons, and some of them are hard to master.

=== How did they take away their own flag? ===
In [[capture]] games, you can press '''F''' (per default) to pick up the flag in your own base, so the enemy cannot reach it that easily. The same button can also be used to drop a flag you carry, be it yours or the enemy's.

=== Why are there no ammo and health pickups? ===
In Red Eclipse, players have an unlimited supply of weapon reloads, health regeneration and impulse energy. Therefore, map control is less important, and everyone can focus on the real fun: Capturing that flag, grabbing that bomber ball ... or just fraging!

=== A green beeping thing obscured my vision - what the heck? ===
Someone has probably just thrown a mine on you. Mines are sticky. And yes, they explode.
