[[File:RE-icon-16x16.png]] '''''What is Red Eclipse?'''''
<p>[http://www.redeclipse.net/ Red Eclipse] is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer multiplayer] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter first-person shooter], similar to games in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament Unreal Tournament] series.</p>



[[File:RE-icon-16x16.png]] '''''What makes Red Eclipse unique?'''''
<ul>
<li>Red Eclipse is different from other games in its gameplay formula, which hopes to shift the focus of skill from controlling a map's items to strictly coordination in combat. It does this in several ways:

<ul>
<li>''Varied movement''
{| style="font-size:95%"
| Through the [[Game::play|Impulse]] system the player is allowed a variety of moves to approach any situation
|}

<li>''Equally-balanced weapons''
{| style="font-size:95%"
| All [[Game::weapons|weapons]] are balanced in hopes of standing 1:1 against any other in combat, versus other hierarchical systems, in which certain weapons are preferred over others
|}

<li>''Unlimited ammunition and regenerative health''
{| style="font-size:95%"
| Eliminating these as factors in success allows for more equal combat situations
|}

<li>''No power-ups or items''
{| style="font-size:95%"
|Due to the above no items are needed - time taken to regain health and load ammo is the limiting factor rather than lacking in health packs and ammunition on a map
|}
</ul>

<li>Red Eclipse also has a built-in, real-time, in-game map editor, which has a low learning curve and can even be used cooperatively online.


<li>The game also has an extensive list of changeable [[Game::vars|gameplay variables]] for the weapons (model and HUD color, name, damage, projectile customization, physics) and environment (gravity, player movement, Impulse customization), allowing for custom modes and weapons.


<li>Lastly, Red Eclipse is a totally [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html Free] project, and is developed by and for the community at no cost to the end user.
</ul>
