In the lower-right corner of your screen in editing mode, you'll see numerous text indicators giving you more information about your map. Here is a short description of each parameter. 

* cube: the number of cubes in the current selection. Only the visible (leaf)cubes are counted.

* fps: frames per second.

* ond: number of cubes in the system. This includes parent cubes, copied cubes, and undos.

* va: number of vertex arrays used to store vertecies in the map.

* vtr: number of triangles currently being displayed. Will be a useful stat when culling is done.

* vvt: number of vertecies currently being displayed. Again, useful when culling is done.

* tri: number of triangles in the entire map.

* wvt: number of vertecies in the entire map.

* evt: misc rendering effects. stuff like particles displayed, or text written on screen.
