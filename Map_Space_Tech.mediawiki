=== Notes & Strategies ===

* It is worth climbing up the pillar in the center, for there is a rocket there
* Making use of the teleporters at the far ends of the lower platforms can throw off your enemies
* The flamer can be acquired by impulse jumping from the platform adjacent to the pillar that looks towards the lower platforms
* The center pillar can be climbed up from the ladders embedded on it. Do not waste your time bouncing against the wall!
