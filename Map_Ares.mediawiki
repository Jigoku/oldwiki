=== Review ===

Taking a trip back to Greek times has never been so full of glorious violence. Breath in the hot, flak-filled air as you impulse around several temples and submerge yourself underwater. The god of war fully approves.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* The map's title comes from the Greek god of War of the same name.
* Ares is quite open, and therefore gameplay is more fast-paced then it's size lets on.
* The rocket spawns in an underwater tunnel; you will be slow coming out of the water, so be ready for some fire when you emerge.
* Climb onto the roofs of one of the temples for a comfy camping spot
