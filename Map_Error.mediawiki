=== Review ===

This tight map lost none of it's Quake III charm when it was ported. Proving Grounds is reincarnated as Fatal Error. Boasting a convoluted layout and bright lighting, this old-timer proves it's always good to be back for seconds.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Proving Grounds was originally seen in ''Quake III Arena''; in ''Quake Live'' there is a modified version, renamed ''"Proving Grounds II"''. 
* The rocket spawns on the side of the pillar in the main room.
* Popular for duel, Error is also suitable for fast-paced instagib matches.
