With Red Eclipse 2.0 looming on the horizon, a lot of changes are being made.

This page will be frequently edited to reflect the current ideology of the developers.

=== '''Maps''' ===

----



As Molexted likes to refer to it, the "dumpster fire of maps" will be cleaned up.

Maps that do not fit these criteria will be removed / rejected:


* Does not fit the general style, lore or direction of the game.

* The map layout does not flow well or is too simple / too open for the current game physics.

* The quality of the map is poor (poor details, repetitive textures, rampant bugs) and no remake is in the pipeline.

* The general concensus points to people not liking the map



Some of the maps in this list have been reworked and have been marked as such.
Otherwise, you can find the reason for its removal next to it.

== Maps being added ==

* Polaris
** Duel map, very small, set far to the north in the mountains. 4 rooms, asymmetrical, no rocket.
* Plantation
** Large FFA/DAC map, asymmetrical, made a couple years ago by Rabidbutton

== Maps to be kept, no change ==

* Conflict
** Keep as-is, despite marginal layout
* Darkness

* Decay
** Keep as-is
* Fatal Error
** Keep as-is
* Nova
** Keep as-is
* Octavus
** Keep as-is or with remix
* Suspended
** Keep as-is, may recieve facelift
* Ubik

== Maps to be kept, have a remix ==

* Abuse
** Has remix: Toxic Abuse
* Panic
** Remix made: Tau
* Pumpstation
** Keeping as team map only, has remix

== Maps to be kept, need a remix ==

These maps have adequate layouts; however, they do not meet Red Eclipse's art standards or its art direction.


* Bloodlust
** Has a remix in the pipeline: Bioluminescence
* Cargo
** Undecided, badly needs a remix to stay
* Castle
** Removed, unless Molexted comes up with something
* Center
** Remix is planned
* Deli
** Keep with a remix
* Depot
** Remix is planned
* Enyo
** Keep with a remix
* Ghost
** Keep with a remix, ghost-esport
* Institute
** Undecided
* Livefire
** Keep with a remix
* Tribal
** Keep with a remip and remix

== Maps under consideration ==

These maps have relatively poor layouts but may be kept due to a shortage of maps or popular demand.

* Affluence
** Undecided, simple layout
* Canyon
** Undecided, poor terrain geometry and middling layout
* Discontinuity
** Undecided
* Dutility
** Undecided, likely to be kept for reasons other than merit
* Erosion
** Undecided, confusing layout
* Longestyard
** Undecided, very small, simple, and ugly, but popular

*Tonaituh
** May require special marking as a "bonus map" as was originally intended; not a pure speed race map due to multiple corridors, and does not fit theme

== Maps marked for removal ==

These maps are poorly laid out, making them impossible to fix. They may also have very poor texturing, but layout is the primary reason for dropping these maps.

* Ares 
** Removed, does not fit the theme of the game and the layout is too open. It is thus unsalvageable
* Bath
** Removed, layout is unsalvageable
* Battlefield
** Removed, terrain unsuitable for current physics
* Biolytic
** Removed, people do not enjoy it due to confusing, unbalanced layout
* Campgrounds
** Removed, very poor port of a Quake 3 Arena map, fugly
* Cutec
** Removed, layout is too open
