=== Notes & Strategies ===

* You can step on the bounce pad immediately below and jump up to get either of the rockets. There is no need to waste your time climbing around it if you are on the lower level.
* Lunge off of the pusher platforms and bounce around the map. This lets you to move around the map faster and makes you harder to hit.
