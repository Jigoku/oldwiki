=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Lob flak (either a grenade or the shotgun's alternative fire) down the tunnels near the bases and by the tops of the stairs to hit those running by.
* The hallways leading to each base contain a raised, decorative strip down the center which has no collision detection. If you drop a mine through that strip, it will be totally invisible, and a nasty surprise for the unlucky soul who triggers it.
* The rocket spawns in the center of the map; watch for it while you fight. In bomber ball and defend the flag, the ball or flag appears there instead, but there you'll find rockets to either side of it.
