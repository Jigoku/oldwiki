The beginner's guide covers tips about game modes and weapons, basic controls and hud elements.

==Game modes==
Most matches of Red Eclispe are played with two competing teams and a time limit. When the match ends, the team with the highest score wins. 
{|
|[[File:Deathmatch.png|64px]]
|One way to score points is to finish off enemies, while killing team mates or blowing up yourself is penalized with point loss. This is the heart of the [[Deathmatch]] (DM) game mode.
|}
Players can score bonus points according to the [[Deathmatch Scoring|deathmatch scoring system]]. Team scores in other modes than [[Deathmatch]] are objective based. 
{|
|[[File:Capture.png|64px]]
| ''[[Capture-the-flag]]''
|The aim of the popular CTF game mode is to get both flags to your base. Defending the flag in your own team's base is a good strategy for beginners, as defenders get a powerful buff, and can stay just where they respawn.
|-
|[[File:Defend.png|64px]]
| [[Defend-and-control]]
|Use the radar to find and defend control points secured by your team. Be sure to avoid killing team mates that are defending a control point. Overthrowing enemy control points may be more challenging than defending yours.
|-
|[[File:Bomber.png|64px]]
| [[Bomber-ball]]
|Players defending their team's base get a strong buff, so again, this is a good idea for beginners. If you catch a bomb, throw it using the '''F''' key before it explodes. If you can move the bomb towards the enemy base, that's even better.

Further [[GameModes and Mutators|game modes]] are ''map editing'' and [[race]]. A large array of general or mode specific [[Mutator Tips|mutators]] offers a wide variety of additional or alternate game rules.

==Weapons overview==
Usually, all players are equipped with a pistol and '''two''' chosen [[Weapons#loadout weapons|loadout weapons]], while additional [[Weapons#explosives|explosives]] can be collected in the arena. Each weapon has its strategic purpose and advantages, but some weapons may be better suited for beginners than others.

|-
|rowspan=2|
|[[file:melee.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Melee|Melee]]
|Simply jump at an enemy and press '''Q'''. Works well in conjunction with close range weaponry.
|-
|[[file:pistol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Pistol|Pistol]]
|Do not forget your pistol. It may have a small clip size, but it can be a deadly weapon.
|-
|rowspan=7|Loadout
|[[file:swordcol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Sword|Sword]]
|The sword is not quite beginner-friendly, as it requires good movement skills to be used effectively.
|-
|[[file:shotguncol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Shotgun|Shotgun]]
|'''Recommended.''' Works best at close range and reloads automatically.
|-
|[[file:smgcol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#SMG|SMG]]
|The sub-machine-gun is straight forward to use, but beginners may have a hard time killing enemies.
|-
|[[file:flamercol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Flamer|Flamer]]
|'''Recommended'''. Trick jumps are hard to master, but it is easy to hit enemies with flames and air blasts. The latter cannot hurt team mates and even extinguishes flames.
|-
|[[file:plasmacol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Plasma|Plasma]]
|Beginners should be careful with the plasma's alternate fire mode, as it is typically used to block enemy pathways, and can be a major annoyance for team mates. 
|-
|[[file:Zappercol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#zapper|Zapper]]
|'''Recommended.''' A great support weapon with limited damage potential, but very effective to slow down enemies and friends alike. 
|-
|[[file:riflecol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Rifle|Rifle]]
|A great choice for those with a good aim, but needs practice to master. 
|-
|rowspan=3|Explosives
|[[file:grenadecol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Grenade|Grenade]]
|Can instantly kill at any range, but requires good timing and aim to be effective. 
|-
|[[file:minecol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Mine|Mine]]
|Be careful when placing mines in your team's base. Team chat can be useful to ask or warn team mates.
|-
|[[file:rocketcol.png|40px]]
|[[weapons#Rocket|Rocket]]
|Although the rocket has a large area of effect, it still requires some aim and timing to be used effectively.

Red Eclipse features a parkour system that allows players to do certain moves which are both fun and useful in games. Using techniques requires impulse, a form of energy that automatically regenerates over time (more-so when you're not moving and crouching). Parkour mainly revolves around the "Q" key. There are many moves with variations that can help in fighting your opponents, as well as run away from them. Knowing all the few [[Impulse_moves|impulse moves]] can be greatly beneficial in matches.

==HUD==
[[File:Annotated GUI.png|frame|center|alt"In-game HUD"|The default HUD in-game with annotation numbers explained below (temporary image)]]<br />
#Message area: As well as kills and assists, other match events such as the capturing of flags are displayed.
#Team icon: FFA games have no teams (neutral). Otherwise, games will have 2 teams (Alpha and Omega) or if the multi mutator is selected, 4 teams (Alpha, Omega, Kappa and Sigma) which is indicated here.
#Special kill notifications area: When you achieve [[Deathmatch_Scoring|special milestones]] in a match a message will display here.
#Crosshair/Radar: The crosshair shows how much ammo you have in your current [[Weapons#clip|clip]]. The radar allows you to see where all players are relative to you, both friend and foe (the color representing their team) which this allows you to appropriately hunt as well as run away. It also shows where items and mode-specific objects (flags or the bomber ball) to guide where you should go.
#Obituary notification area: Whenever you directly kill (not assist) a player, a message will show up here which informs of how the player died and any specific milestones.
#Impulse meter: You regain impulse when not using any [[Impulse_moves|parkour techniques]]. Slower movement and crouching speeds up impulse regeneration.
#Health meter: You regain health except in survivor and duel modes. Health regeneration restores 5hp per second, but is interrupted for 3 seconds whenever you take damage.
#Weapons- These are the [[weapons]] that you currently hold. The weapon you have currently equipped will be shown with a larger icon. Note the numbers shown here correspond to hotkeys.
#Objective status: If not in a deathmatch game, the objective status will be shown here. Specific modes will show different arrangements- defend and control will have multiple flags show which represent all the control points in the map and their status, for example.
#Mode/mutators: The icons here represent the [[Modes and Mutators in SVN|mode and mutators]] of the match.
