I don't get what the function you put here is good for, but the corresponding collection of scripts on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Common.js) provides some useful features, such as collapsible tables, which can be nice for navigation bar templates at the bottom of related pages.
: Yeah, I'm still new to how MediaWiki works but pretty much skys the limit when you've got power over js and css. The script I put on is used for a horizontal list script I found and probably more. Actually was thinking of collapsible sections for an all-inclusive weapons page.--[[User:Honno|Honno]] ([[User talk:Honno|talk]]) 11:16, 3 February 2015 (EST)
