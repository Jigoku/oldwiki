|Attack enemy players gathering frags, assists, sprees and other bonuses to score points according to the [[Deathmatch Scoring]] System. The team or individual with the most points at the end wins!

==tips & strategy==

* In a team match, working together is the key to success. Scoring an assist means a higher overall score for your team, and multiple players can overtake an enemy much faster.
* In a Free-for-All match (also popular with the duel & survivor mutators), target groups of players close to you with high-spread ammo weapons, or target solitary players using weapons that require greater accuracy. To lose focus means to lose points!
* Regardless of what mutators are active, always avoid team kills. You and/or your team will lose points quickly if you neglect to avoid friendly fire, especially when it comes to explosives.
* Using the flamer's secondary fire you can put out flames on yourself by pointing at the ground, and on others by pointing at them (which causes no harm to teammates).
* In Survivor Deathmatch, remember that to survive is everything, while the total amount of frags matters far less. Maintain a low profile and target the most difficult opponents first.
* In Classic Deathmatch, map control can be the difference between winning and losing. Learn the locations of your favorite weapon spawns and plan accordingly.
* In Duel Deathmatch, awareness of the location of your opponent at all times is very important. Choose a radar style that suits you from the options menu, or when radar is disabled (in the Hard mutator for example) turn music volume down to hear footsteps.

==Mode specific mutators==

* Use the claws to push your enemies out of the arena. 
* Claws and explosives have greatly increased pushback, but other weapons are disabled. 
* This is typically combined with the basic and survivor mutators.

===old school===

|
* Only frags count for your score and team score - each kill is worth one point. 
* This means there are no bonus points for assists, headshots, sprees etc. 
* A team kill only subtracts one point, so the penalty is lighter than usually.

'''Note:''' Deathmatch is also the most commonly played game mode for some popular mutators, in particular [[Mutator Tips#duel|Duel]] and [[Mutator Tips#Survivor|Survivor]].
