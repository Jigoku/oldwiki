Is it correct to add \[\[User:\]\] to the author? Wouldn't it create a lot of [wanted pages](Special:WantedPages "wikilink")? --[Swooboo](User:Swooboo "wikilink") ([talk](User_talk:Swooboo "wikilink")) 17:10, 21 December 2014 (EST)

Also, is it possible to take the date of the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS and convert it to itself + "%% Days ago" ? --[Swooboo](User:Swooboo "wikilink") ([talk](User_talk:Swooboo "wikilink")) 17:14, 21 December 2014 (EST)
